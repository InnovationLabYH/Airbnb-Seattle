## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used Airbnb Seattle data to understand following questions.
1. What are the type of accomodation offered in Seattle and how many each?
2. Does particular season have higher ratings?
3. Which is the most popular type of Airbnb acoomodation in Seattle?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.
